Input:
Read in bed as GR straight away and use function to convert to df for table.
Probably need to switch to read generic function to get extra columns. First 6 must be bed format though?
GTF files?

Genome browser:
1. Show regions across genome (ideoviz?)
2. Show tracks at specific regions (gviz)


Genomes:
Add txdb etc from different releases to get genes or exons.....
GO analysis
Annotation relative to genes etc??

Intersect and overlap multiple beds:
Possible to do intersections, filtering etc.
Bedtools etc..



bigWigAverageOverBed add to granges?

Could just use galaxy with wrappers for seqplots but won't be interactive
EpivizR (slow and crashes)
